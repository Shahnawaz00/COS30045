              The choropleth map provides a visual representation of net overseas migration (NOM) in different states and territories of Australia. The color intensity on the map indicates the migration level, with darker shades representing higher levels of migration. Let's explore the trends and historical context behind these migrations.

            <h3>History and Trends</h3>
            <p>
              Sydney, being one of the most populous cities in Australia, has historically attracted a significant number of migrants. Its economic opportunities, cultural diversity, and vibrant lifestyle make it an attractive destination. On the other hand, Tasmania, with its smaller population and limited economic opportunities, has seen comparatively fewer migrations.
